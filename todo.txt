todo:
    Add timestamp to log
    Make a standard log mode
    Use multiple GRE threads ?
    Add TCP-PPTP encapsulation
    Check MTU issue in GRE thread
    Verify the thread synchro stuff for races
    Packet mapping could be *much* more efficient
    Verify the id mapping stuff for control packets
    Check for multiple GRE listeners on machine and warn
    Add on-the-fly resolution of addresses instead of at start
    If remote tcp connection hangs, all hangs !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    Plant a cookie smoewhere in the control packet to make sure the proxies aren't in a cycle.
    See to remove that ugly second strdup in pairs.cpp

done:
    Deal properly with multi-IP
    Use r/w locks on the id database
    In gre.cpp, sendto in many passes makes _no_ sense
